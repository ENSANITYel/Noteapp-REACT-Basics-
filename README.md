# Noteapp-REACT-Basics-

# I had try out how does react work and calling works in js while big webpages are called so that if there are any deafult loop holes while calling cann be exploited or not

# since first loophole html injectionn was done based on a bad coding of html while building a calculator

# i thought  what about a notepad 

# most of the websites does have a chatbot and why not start with notedpad inject sql and try with it and while through the process can learn a bit of react too and its working 

# it wa skind of successful would post my next  project on sql injection over my on react based note app

#If you guys wanna watch can go through the code its pretty basic to understand

# thank you
